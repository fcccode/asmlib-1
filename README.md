asmlib
======

This is a library of optimized subroutines coded in assembly language. The functions in this library can be called from C, C++ and other compiled high-level languages. Supports many different compilers under Windows, Linux, BSD and Mac OS X operating systems, 32 and 64 bits. This library contains faster versions of common C/C++ memory and string functions, fast functions for string search and string parsing, fast integer division and integer vector division, as well as several useful functions not found elsewhere.
